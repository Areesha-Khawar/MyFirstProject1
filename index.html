                    <p>Everything changes. nothing stays the same forever. the seasons too are changing. autumn is near. i dont know why but i have always considered autumn to be a gloomy weather. but sometimes sadness is also crucial, it makes you value happiness more.</p>

                    <p2>It's finally autumn now. i have finished reading the books i started. I tried baking cookies today. And Oh My God! did the kitchen smell heavenly! i made a single batch (my mistake) and they were gone within minutes, not a single cookie left. i dont know if i should be happy at the fact that everyone liked them so much or be sad at not having more than one myself...</p2>
